            <h1>About Me - Zana Saeed</h1>
            <p>Hi there! My name is Zana Saeed, and I was born on April 2, 1997. I am a determined individual who has had an interesting journey so far.</p>
            <p>After completing my secondary school education in Handel & Economie, I unfortunately couldn't finish my MBO studies due to a broken collarbone during my final exams. However, this setback didn't discourage me, and I embarked on a different path.</p>
            <p>For the next six years, I found success as an entrepreneur in various trades such as plumbing, carpentry, and solar panel installation. This hands-on experience allowed me to develop practical skills and a strong work ethic.</p>
            <p>In February 2022, I decided to pursue my passion for technology and enrolled in a full-stack development bootcamp at Hogeschool Novi. Eager to fully immerse myself in this new career path, I spent seven months living in Thailand, where I could focus solely on my transition from the construction industry to the world of IT.</p>
            <p>During this time, I dedicated myself to learning and honing my skills in web development, software engineering, and all aspects of the full-stack development process. I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead in this field and the opportunities to create innovative solutions through technology.</p>
            <p>Combining my practical experience as an entrepreneur with my newfound knowledge in IT, I am ready to take on new challenges and contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology. My journey has taught me resilience, adaptability, and the importance of continuous learning.</p>
            <p>I am eager to leverage my diverse background and skills to make a positive impact in the world of technology and contribute to innovative projects and teams.</p>
